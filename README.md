This repository contains system models and datasets exploring strategies to achieve net-zero emissions across the cement and concrete cycle.

The details and results of this model are published as the following journal article:

Takuma Watari, Zhi Cao, Sho Hata, and Keisuke Nansai (2022) Efficient use of cement and concrete to reduce reliance on supply-side technologies for net-zero emissions, Nature Communications, DOI

The code is based on https://github.com/ZhiCaoIE/imagine-concrete and has been modified to analyze the Japanese cement and concrete cycle.
